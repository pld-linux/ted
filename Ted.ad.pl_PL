!!  Example application resources file for 'Ted'.			!!

!!  This file can be used to set Ted's application resources, such as	!!
!!  the texts on menu options or buttons, or to set your preferences	!!
!!  for certain values.							!!
!!									!!
!!  The values given in the English example resource file are those	!!
!!  that are compiled into the program. It only makes sense to make and	!!
!!  install a modified file when it is different from the default one.	!!
!!  For simplicity and to save yourself a lot of work it is important	!!
!!  to realize that all values given in the English example file are	!!
!!  also compiled into the standard Ted program. You only have to save	!!
!!  the lines that you change in personalized or localized versions of	!!
!!  a resource file.							!!
!!									!!
!!  When you translate this resource file to a particular language,	!!
!!  please only translate the messages, and adapt the default unit and	!!
!!  paper size to the traditions of your country. The other		!!
!!  configurable resources are a matter of personal taste that is best	!!
!!  dealt with by the author of this program or the individual user.	!!
!!									!!
!!  For those that want to contribute their translation to the Ted	!!
!!  source: The administrative process that merges the '.ad' files	!!
!!  with the latest version of the original does not support the '\'	!!
!!  mechanism for continuation lines. Please do not use it in the files	!!
!!  you submit.								!!
!!									!!
!!  Translated resource files re periodically merged with the latest	!!
!!  sample resource file. Original translators comments are lost in	!!
!!  this process. Comments between the first @TranslatorStart and	!!
!!  @TranslatorEnd lines are however copied over to the merge result.	!!
!!  In the merged file, the lines that have not (yet) been translated	!!
!!  by you are marked as a special kind of comment: The line starts	!!
!!  with '!=='. When you translate a line, remove the comment sign such	!!
!!  that the line starts with 'Ted'. If you do not want to translate a	!!
!!  line, either leave it alone or delete it. It is up to you to decide	!!
!!  what is the most convenient to you.					!!
!!									!!
!!  The syntax for giving menu shortcuts in X11 resource files has its	!!
!!  peculiarities. As you only need to include values that you want to	!!
!!  be different from the defaults in a private version of the file, it	!!
!!  is wise just to leave the menu shortcuts alone. For detailed	!!
!!  information refer to the Xt documentation. E.G. to paragraph 8.1	!!
!!  (p244) of the Xt programming manual. (See the reference below).	!!
!!  Another unfortunate thing is that (invisible) white space at the	!!
!!  end of a line in the resource file may make a shortcut		!!
!!  syntactically incorrect.						!!
!!									!!
!!  Refer to the X11/Motif documentation on how to use this file.	!!
!!  I suggest to save the lines you changed to personalize resources in	!!
!!  a file called $HOME/Ted. For a detailed discussion and a graphical	!!
!!  schema (p307) refer to to paragraph 10.2.3 of the Xt programming	!!
!!  manual. (See the reference below) In environments where you log in	!!
!!  through X Windows, the $HOME/.Xresources file takes the role of	!!
!!  the $HOME/.Xdefaults file. For more information try to understand	!!
!!  the 'xrdb' manual page.						!!
!!									!!
!!  The standard X11 command line arguments to override a resource	!!
!!  value for a single invocation work as well. E.G:			!!
!!  Ted -xrm Ted.usePostScriptFilters:1					!!
!!	-xrm Ted.usePostScriptIndexedImages:1 ++printToFile x.rtf y.ps	!!
!!  uses the special PostScript settings for this invocation only. For	!!
!!  more information read the X manual page.				!!
!!									!!
!!  System wide configuration settings like the default paper size can	!!
!!  be set in the file /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Ted. For exact		!!
!!  details, refer to the X11 documentation and the book mentioned	!!
!!  above.								!!
!!									!!
!!  When you translate this file to a certain language $LANG, the file	!!
!!  with the translated messages can be stored in a file called		!!
!!  /usr/lib/X11/${LANG}/app-defaults/Ted. E.G. For European French the	!!
!!  translated file is /usr/lib/X11/fr_FR/app-defaults/Ted.		!!
!!  NOTE that I have encountered situations in which this does not	!!
!!  work. When your X11 implementation obstinately refuses to use the	!!
!!  translated file, it is possible to influence the language that the	!!
!!  Xt toolkit uses bypassing the LANG environment variable. This can	!!
!!  be done in in two ways:						!!
!!  -   Insert a line 'Ted.xnlLanguage: fr_FR' in $HOME/.Xdefaults	!!
!!	When you log in through X Windows, you might have to insert	!!
!!	the line in $HOME/.Xresources.					!!
!!  -   Pass the language as a command line argument to Ted. E.G.	!!
!!	'Ted -xnllanguage fr_FR' or 'Ted -xnllanguage fr_FR *.rtf'	!!
!!  Note the difference in capitalization of the L.			!!
!!									!!
!!  Strictly speaking, the background clor of the windows is not a Ted	!!
!!  resource but a general Motif resource. Those that do not like the	!!
!!  blue background of Motif 1.2 (LessTif) can change the background	!!
!!  color with the following resource setting:				!!
!!									!!
!!  Ted*background: gray						!!
!!									!!
!!  Strictly speaking, the font that is used for all menu items and	!!
!!  controls is not a 'Ted' resource but a general Motif resource. Ted	!!
!!  does not set a default for it. The Motif default can be overridden	!!
!!  by setting the 'fontList' resource. E.G. including the following	!!
!!  line in your .Xdefaults file, or in $HOME/Ted, lets Ted use the	!!
!!  'times' font for all controls. Setting a default font for the texts	!!
!!  is particularly important when you have translated the messages to	!!
!!  some language using a special character set, or for the spelling	!!
!!  tool in a language that uses a special character set.		!!
!!									!!
!!  Ted*fontList: -adobe-times-bold-r-*-*-*-100-*-*-*-*-*-*		!!
!!									!!
!!  E.G. for Eastern European languages like Slovak, Czech and Polish	!!
!!  the following might me a good setting:				!!
!!									!!
!!  Ted*fontList: -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-*-100-*-*-*-*-iso8859-2	!!

!!			into the command. For examples of this feature	!!

!!  supportXvCopyPaste:	Setting this resource enables copy/paste with	!!
!!			John Bradly's XV program. As the XV copy/paste	!!
!!			mechanism has its peculiarities, this is off by	!!
!!			default. To enable set the resource value to 1.	!!
!!									!!
!!  usePostScriptFilters: PostScript levels 2 and 3 support the concept	!!
!!			of filters. Filters make it possible to code	!!
!!			the images in a PostScript file much more	!!
!!			efficiently. You can activate this option when	!!
!!			you have a printer that supports level 2 	!!
!!			filters and the /FlateDecode filter. Recent	!!
!!			versions of GhostScript support both. If you	!!
!!			doubt, just activate the option and see whether	!!
!!			you can still print images. To activate set the	!!
!!			value to 1.					!!
!!									!!
!!  usePostScriptIndexedImages: PostScript level 2 has a variant of the	!!
!!			'image' operator that makes it possible to	!!
!!			include images with a color indirection via a	!!
!!			palette in the PostScript file. As many if the	!!
!!			images included in rtf documents are of this	!!
!!			kind, setting this resource can help you to	!!
!!			reduce the volume of the PostScript that is	!!
!!			sent to the printer. All level 2 		!!
!!			implementaions, including GhostScript support	!!
!!			indexed images. If you doubt, just activate the	!!
!!			the option and see whether you can still print	!!
!!			images. To activate set the value to 1.		!!

!!			document.					!!
!!									!!
!!  selectionColor:	The name of the color that is used to highlight	!!

!!			used to display the selected part of the	!!
!!			document.					!!
!!  copiedSelectionColor: The name of the color that is used to		!!
!!			highlight the selection, when it is copied. On	!!
!!			systems with very few colors this resource is	!!
!!			ignored and reverse drawing is used to display	!!
!!			the selected part of the document.		!!
!!									!!
!!  defaultAnsicpg:	The number of the code page that is assumed	!!
!!			when a document does nor contain an 'ansicpg'	!!
!!			rtf tag. It is also used when new documents	!!
!!			are made. In general it is not desirable to set	!!
!!			this resource without installing appropriate	!!
!!			fonts.						!!
!!			E.G: 1252 for englist speaking countries and	!!
!!			Western Europe. 1250 for Central Europe and	!!
!!			1251 for that part of Eastern Europe that uses	!!
!!			the Cyrillic alphabet.				!!
